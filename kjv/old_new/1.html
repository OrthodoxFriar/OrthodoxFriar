      <h1>Reading for January 1</h1>
      <h2>Genesis</h2>
      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
      <p>1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.
      </p>
      <p>3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
      </p>
      <p>4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.
      </p>
      <p>5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.
      </p>
      <p>6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the waters.
      </p>
      <p>7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:
and it was so.
      </p>
      <p>8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.
      </p>
      <p>9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
      </p>
      <p>10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
      </p>
      <p>11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is
in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
      </p>
      <p>12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.
      </p>
      <p>13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.
      </p>
      <p>14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years: 
      </p>
      <p>15 And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was
so.
      </p>
      <p>16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
      </p>
      <p>17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth, 
      </p>
      <p>18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and
to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
      </p>
      <p>19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
      </p>
      <p>20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
      </p>
      <p>22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
      </p>
      <p>23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
      </p>
      <p>24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
kind: and it was so.
      </p>
      <p>25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.
      </p>
      <p>26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.
      </p>
      <p>28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
      </p>
      <p>30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
      </p>
      <p>31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
      <p>1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them.
      </p>
      <p>2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
      </p>
      <p>3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that
in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
      </p>
      <p>4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
heavens, 
      </p>
      <p>5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,
and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not
caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the
ground.
      </p>
      <p>6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.
      </p>
      <p>7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.
      </p>
      <p>8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed.
      </p>
      <p>9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
      </p>
      <p>10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence
it was parted, and became into four heads.
      </p>
      <p>11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
      </p>
      <p>12 And the gold of that
land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
      </p>
      <p>13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
      </p>
      <p>14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
      </p>
      <p>15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
Eden to dress it and to keep it.
      </p>
      <p>16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat: 
      </p>
      <p>17 But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
      </p>
      <p>18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
      </p>
      <p>19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.
      </p>
      <p>20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an
help meet for him.
      </p>
      <p>21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof; 

      <p>22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made
he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
      </p>
      <p>23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
      </p>
      <p>24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
      </p>
      <p>25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.

      <h2>Matthew</h2>
      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
      <p>1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the
son of Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas
and his brethren; 
      </p>
      <p>3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and
Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 
      </p>
      <p>4 And Aram begat Aminadab;
and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 
      </p>
      <p>5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat
Jesse; 
      </p>
      <p>6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; 
      </p>
      <p>7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 
      </p>
      <p>8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 
      </p>
      <p>9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
      </p>
      <p>10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
begat Josias; 
      </p>
      <p>11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about
the time they were carried away to Babylon: 
      </p>
      <p>12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; 
      </p>
      <p>13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim;
and Eliakim begat Azor; 
      </p>
      <p>14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 
      </p>
      <p>15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 
      </p>
      <p>16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
      </p>
      <p>17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are
fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto
Christ are fourteen generations.
      </p>
      <p>18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was
found with child of the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
      </p>
      <p>20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David,
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived
in her is of the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
      </p>
      <p>22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 
      </p>
      <p>23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
      </p>
      <p>24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 
      </p>
      <p>25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
