        <h2>Genesis</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
      <p>1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I
will shew thee: 
      </p>
      <p>2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I
will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a
blessing: 
      </p>
      <p>3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him
that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
blessed.
      </p>
      <p>4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went
with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed
out of Haran.
      </p>
      <p>5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all
their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;
and into the land of Canaan they came.
      </p>
      <p>6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto
the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
      </p>
      <p>7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who
appeared unto him.
      </p>
      <p>8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:
and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name
of the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
      </p>
      <p>10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
      </p>
      <p>11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon: 
      </p>
      <p>12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when
the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:
and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
      </p>
      <p>13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
      </p>
      <p>14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
      </p>
      <p>15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
      </p>
      <p>16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,
and camels.
      </p>
      <p>17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of Sarai Abram’s wife.
      </p>
      <p>18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  
      </p>
      <p>19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to
wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
      </p>
      <p>20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
away, and his wife, and all that he had.

      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>
      <p>1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
had, and Lot with him, into the south.
      </p>
      <p>2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
      </p>
      <p>3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto
the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and
Hai; 
      </p>
      <p>4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents.
      </p>
      <p>6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
together.
      </p>
      <p>7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and
the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite
dwelled then in the land.
      </p>
      <p>8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
brethren.
      </p>
      <p>9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;
or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
      </p>
      <p>10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,
as thou comest unto Zoar.
      </p>
      <p>11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
      </p>
      <p>12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
      </p>
      <p>13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
exceedingly.
      </p>
      <p>14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 
      </p>
      <p>15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for
ever.
      </p>
      <p>16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a
man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered.
      </p>
      <p>17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
      </p>
      <p>18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
      <p>1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of
nations; 
      </p>
      <p>2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
      </p>
      <p>3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
the salt sea.
      </p>
      <p>4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
they rebelled.
      </p>
      <p>5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the
Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
      </p>
      <p>6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
      </p>
      <p>7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that
dwelt in Hazezontamar.
      </p>
      <p>8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of
Siddim; 
      </p>
      <p>9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king
of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
four kings with five.
      </p>
      <p>10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled
to the mountain.
      </p>
      <p>11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
victuals, and went their way.
      </p>
      <p>12 And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom,
and his goods, and departed.
      </p>
      <p>13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;
for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and
brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
      </p>
      <p>14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and
eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
      </p>
      <p>15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the
left hand of Damascus.
      </p>
      <p>16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
      </p>
      <p>17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from
the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at
the valley of Shaveh, which is the king’s dale.
      </p>
      <p>18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and
he was the priest of the most high God.
      </p>
      <p>19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high
God, possessor of heaven and earth: 
      </p>
      <p>20 And blessed be the most high
God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him
tithes of all.
      </p>
      <p>21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and
take the goods to thyself.
      </p>
      <p>22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
      </p>
      <p>23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,
I have made Abram rich: 
      </p>
      <p>24 Save only that which the young men have
eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,
and Mamre; let them take their portion.

        <h3>Matthew</h3>
      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
      <p>1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he
was set, his disciples came unto him: 
      </p>
      <p>2 And he opened his mouth, and
taught them, saying, 
      </p>
      <p>3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
      </p>
      <p>5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
      </p>
      <p>6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:
for they shall be filled.
      </p>
      <p>7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
      </p>
      <p>8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
      </p>
      <p>9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
of God.
      </p>
      <p>10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake:
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
      </p>
      <p>12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
      </p>
      <p>13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
      </p>
      <p>14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
cannot be hid.
      </p>
      <p>15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on
a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
      </p>
      <p>16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
      </p>
      <p>17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
      </p>
      <p>18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
      </p>
      <p>22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever
shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but
whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
      </p>
      <p>23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; 
      </p>
      <p>24 Leave there
thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
      </p>
      <p>25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge,
and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into
prison.
      </p>
      <p>26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,
till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
