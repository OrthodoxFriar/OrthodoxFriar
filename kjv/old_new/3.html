      <h2>Genesis</h2>
      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
      <p>1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
      </p>
      <p>2 That the sons of God saw
the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of
all which they chose.
      </p>
      <p>3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years.
      </p>
      <p>4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
renown.
      </p>
      <p>5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.
      </p>
      <p>6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at his heart.
      </p>
      <p>7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and
the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
      </p>
      <p>8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
      </p>
      <p>10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
      </p>
      <p>11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled
with violence.
      </p>
      <p>12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I
will destroy them with the earth.
      </p>
      <p>14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
      </p>
      <p>15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty
cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
      </p>
      <p>16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
      </p>
      <p>17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under
heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
      </p>
      <p>18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives
with thee.
      </p>
      <p>19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be
male and female.
      </p>
      <p>20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort
shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
      </p>
      <p>21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
      </p>
      <p>22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
      <p>1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
      </p>
      <p>2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and
his female.
      </p>
      <p>3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
      </p>
      <p>4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have
made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
      </p>
      <p>6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives
with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
      </p>
      <p>8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 
      </p>
      <p>9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, 
as God had commanded Noah.
      </p>
      <p>10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
      </p>
      <p>12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
      </p>
      <p>13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons
with them, into the ark; 
      </p>
      <p>14 They, and every beast after his kind,
and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,
every bird of every sort.
      </p>
      <p>15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
      </p>
      <p>16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
      </p>
      <p>17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
      </p>
      <p>18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
      </p>
      <p>19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
      </p>
      <p>20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.
      </p>
      <p>21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man: 
      </p>
      <p>22 All in whose nostrils was the
breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
      </p>
      <p>23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the
fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah
only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
      </p>
      <p>24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.
      </p>

      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>
      <p>1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over
the earth, and the waters asswaged; 
      </p>
      <p>2 The fountains also of the deep
and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was
restrained; 
      </p>
      <p>3 And the waters returned from off the earth
continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the
waters were abated.
      </p>
      <p>4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
      </p>
      <p>5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the
mountains seen.
      </p>
      <p>6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
window of the ark which he had made: 
      </p>
      <p>7 And he sent forth a raven,
which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off
the earth.
      </p>
      <p>8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground; 
      </p>
      <p>9 But the dove found no rest
for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for
the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his
hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
      </p>
      <p>10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark; 
      </p>
      <p>11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;
and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that
the waters were abated from off the earth.
      </p>
      <p>12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
which returned not again unto him any more.
      </p>
      <p>13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from
off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,
and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
      </p>
      <p>14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
month, was the earth dried.
      </p>
      <p>15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
      </p>
      <p>16 Go forth of the ark, thou,
and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
      </p>
      <p>17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the
earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’
wives with him: 
      </p>
      <p>19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every
fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
forth out of the ark.
      </p>
      <p>20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
altar.
      </p>
      <p>21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for
the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I
again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
      </p>
      <p>22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

      <h2>Matthew</h2>
      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
      <p>1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
of Judaea, 
      </p>
      <p>2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand.
      </p>
      <p>3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make his paths straight.
      </p>
      <p>4 And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern
girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
      </p>
      <p>5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region
round about Jordan, 
      </p>
      <p>6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing
their sins.
      </p>
      <p>7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?  
      </p>
      <p>8 Bring forth therefore fruits
meet for repentance: 
      </p>
      <p>9 And think not to say within yourselves, We
have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of
these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
and cast into the fire.
      </p>
      <p>11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: 
      </p>
      <p>12
Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and
gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with
unquenchable fire.
      </p>
      <p>13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
baptized of him.
      </p>
      <p>14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,
and comest thou to me?  
      </p>
      <p>15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer
it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.
Then he suffered him.
      </p>
      <p>16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 
      </p>
      <p>17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased.
