      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
      <p>1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
      </p>  
      <p>2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
      <p>3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest
ye die.
      </p>
      <p>4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 
      </p>
      <p>5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
      </p>
      <p>6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.
      </p>
      <p>7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons.
      </p>
      <p>8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
      </p>
      <p>9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
thou?  
      </p>
      <p>10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
      </p>
      <p>11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
      </p>
      <p>12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
      </p>
      <p>13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
      </p>
      <p>14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the
field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life: 
      </p>
      <p>15 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise his heel.
      </p>
      <p>16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
      </p>
      <p>17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 
      </p>
      <p>18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field; 
      </p>
      <p>19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
      </p>
      <p>20 And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother
of all living.
      </p>
      <p>21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins, and clothed them.
      </p>
      <p>22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 
      </p>
      <p>23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
      </p>
      <p>24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep
the way of the tree of life.

      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
      <p>1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
      </p>
      <p>3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 
      </p>
      <p>5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
      </p>
      <p>6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?
      </p>
      <p>7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
      </p>
      <p>8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.
      </p>
      <p>9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?  
      </p>
      <p>10 And he said, What
hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from
the ground.
      </p>
      <p>11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; 
      </p>
      <p>12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
      </p>
      <p>13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can
bear.
      </p>
      <p>14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one
that findeth me shall slay me.
      </p>
      <p>15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark
upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
      </p>
      <p>16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the
land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
      </p>
      <p>17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
son, Enoch.
      </p>
      <p>18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
      </p>
      <p>19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
and the name of the other Zillah.
      </p>
      <p>20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
and of such as have cattle.
      </p>
      <p>21 And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such
as handle the harp and organ.
      </p>
      <p>22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
      </p>
      <p>23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;
ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to
my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
      </p>
      <p>24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
sevenfold.
      </p>
      <p>25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his
name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead
of Abel, whom Cain slew.
      </p>
      <p>26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

      <h3>Matthew</h3>
      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
      <p>1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem, 
      </p>
      <p>2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for
we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
      </p>
      <p>3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and
all Jerusalem with him.
      </p>
      <p>4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
      </p>
      <p>5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
written by the prophet, 
      </p>
      <p>6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda,
art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall
come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
      </p>
      <p>7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of
them diligently what time the star appeared.
      </p>
      <p>8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently
for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again,
that I may come and worship him also.
      </p>
      <p>9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood
over where the young child was.
      </p>
      <p>10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
      </p>
      <p>11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child
with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they
had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense and myrrh.
      </p>
      <p>12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
      </p>
      <p>13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young
child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I
bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
      </p>
      <p>14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt: 
      </p>
      <p>15 And was there until the death of Herod:
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
      </p>
      <p>16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were
in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and
under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the
wise men.
      </p>
      <p>17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
saying, 
      </p>
      <p>18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and
weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and
would not be comforted, because they are not.
      </p>
      <p>19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth
in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
      </p>
      <p>20 Saying, Arise, and take the young
child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are
dead which sought the young child’s life.
      </p>
      <p>21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came
into the land of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room
of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding,
being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of
Galilee: 
      </p>
      <p>23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
called a Nazarene.
