      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
      <p>1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
      </p>
      <p>3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 
      </p>
      <p>5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
      </p>
      <p>6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?
      </p>
      <p>7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
      </p>
      <p>8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.
      </p>
      <p>9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?  
      </p>
      <p>10 And he said, What
hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from
the ground.
      </p>
      <p>11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand; 
      </p>
      <p>12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
      </p>
      <p>13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can
bear.
      </p>
      <p>14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one
that findeth me shall slay me.
      </p>
      <p>15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark
upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
      </p>
      <p>16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the
land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
      </p>
      <p>17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
son, Enoch.
      </p>
      <p>18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
      </p>
      <p>19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
and the name of the other Zillah.
      </p>
      <p>20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
and of such as have cattle.
      </p>
      <p>21 And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such
as handle the harp and organ.
      </p>
      <p>22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
      </p>
      <p>23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;
ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to
my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
      </p>
      <p>24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
sevenfold.
      </p>
      <p>25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his
name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead
of Abel, whom Cain slew.
      </p>
      <p>26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>

      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
      <p>1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
      </p>
      <p>2 That the sons of God saw
the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of
all which they chose.
      </p>
      <p>3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years.
      </p>
      <p>4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
renown.
      </p>
      <p>5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.
      </p>
      <p>6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at his heart.
      </p>
      <p>7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and
the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
      </p>
      <p>8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
      </p>
      <p>10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
      </p>
      <p>11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled
with violence.
      </p>
      <p>12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I
will destroy them with the earth.
      </p>
      <p>14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
      </p>
      <p>15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty
cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
      </p>
      <p>16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
      </p>
      <p>17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under
heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
      </p>
      <p>18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives
with thee.
      </p>
      <p>19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be
male and female.
      </p>
      <p>20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort
shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
      </p>
      <p>21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
      </p>
      <p>22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.

      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
      <p>1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
      </p>
      <p>2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and
his female.
      </p>
      <p>3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
      </p>
      <p>4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have
made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
      </p>
      <p>6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives
with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
      </p>
      <p>8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 
      </p>
      <p>9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, 
as God had commanded Noah.
      </p>
      <p>10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
      </p>
      <p>12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
      </p>
      <p>13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons
with them, into the ark; 
      </p>
      <p>14 They, and every beast after his kind,
and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,
every bird of every sort.
      </p>
      <p>15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
      </p>
      <p>16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
      </p>
      <p>17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
      </p>
      <p>18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
      </p>
      <p>19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
      </p>
      <p>20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.
      </p>
      <p>21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man: 
      </p>
      <p>22 All in whose nostrils was the
breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
      </p>
      <p>23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the
fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah
only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
      </p>
      <p>24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.
